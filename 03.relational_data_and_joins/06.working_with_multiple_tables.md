1. Import [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/launchschool/sql_course_data/master/sql-and-relational-databases/relational-data-and-joins/working-with-multiple-tables/theater_full.sql) into an empty PostgreSQL database. Note: the file contains a lot of data and may take a while to run; your terminal should return to the command prompt once the import is complete.

From the command line:

```sql
$ psql -d sql_book < /Users/nathanworden/Documents/School/Launch_School/LS180_Database_Foundations/03.relational_data_and_joins/theater_full.sql
```

Or if you already have a running `psql` session:

```sql
sql_course=# \i /Users/nathanworden/Documents/School/Launch_School/LS180_Database_Foundations/03.relational_data_and_joins/theater_full.sql
```

2. Write a query that determines how many tickets have been sold.

- ```sql
  SELECT count
  ```
