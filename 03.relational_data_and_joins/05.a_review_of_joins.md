FULL OUTER JOIN - a sort of combination of the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and the `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`. First, an inner join is done. Next, a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` without an additional `INNER JOIN` is performed. Finally, a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` without an additoinal `INNER JOIN` is doine to create the final result SQL table. Remember, that the first steo in both the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and `RIGHT OUTHER JOIN` is to perform as `INNER JOIN` followed by matching rows that don't satisfy the join condition from one table to the other table.





INNER JOIN tells the database that it needs to find a matching row in both tables in order to return data from either one.
