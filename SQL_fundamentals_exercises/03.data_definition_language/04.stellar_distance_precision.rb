Stellar Distance Precision
For many of the closest stars, we know the distance from Earth fairly accurately; for instance, Proxima Centauri is roughly 4.3 light years away. Our database, as currently defined, only allows integer distances, so the most accurate value we can enter is 4. Modify the distance column in the stars table so that it allows fractional light years to any degree of precision required.

Solution
ALTER TABLE stars
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE numeric;
Discussion
There are several different data types we can use to store a number with a fractional component: numeric (also known as decimal), real, and double precision. For this problem, we have simply chosen numeric because it allows numbers of arbitrary size and precision. We could have easily chosen real or double precision as well, but those types are mostly intended for use in applications that perform a lot of mathematical processing.

The main thing to understand with our solution is that we have chosen type numeric without a precision or scale. The precision and scale are optional characteristics that may be specified when creating a numeric column; if they are omitted, PostgreSQL allows values that have any precision or scale.

Further Exploration
Assume the stars table already contains one or more rows of data. What will happen when you try to run the above command? To test this, revert the modification and add a row or two of data:

ALTER TABLE stars
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE integer;

INSERT INTO stars (name, distance, spectral_type, companions)
           VALUES ('Alpha Orionis', 643, 'M', 9);

ALTER TABLE stars
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE numeric ;
