Write a SQL query that shows all items that have had bids put on them. Use the logical operator `IN` for this exercise, as well as a subquery.

Here is the expected output:

```psql
 Bid on Items
---------------
 Video Game
 Outdoor Grill
 Painting
 Tent
 Vase
(5 rows)
```



Witout using `IN` or a subquery:

```sql
SELECT name AS Bid_on_Items FROM items INNER JOIN bids ON item_id = items.id GROUP BY name;
```
