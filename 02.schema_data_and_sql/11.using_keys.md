4. Is it possible to create a swquence that returns only even numbers?

The documentation for sequence might be useful:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-createsequence.html

- Yes. You can do this:

  ```sql
  CREATE SEQUENCE counter INCREMENT BY 2 MINVALUE 2;
  
  SELECT nextval('counter');
  nextval 
  ---------
         2
  (1 row)
  
  SELECT nextval('counter');
  nextval 
  ---------
         4
  (1 row)
  ```

  

5. What will the name of the sequence created by the following SQL statement be?

- regions_id_seq



9. Write a SQL statement that modifies the table `films` to remove its primary key while preserving the `id` column and the values it contains.

- ALTER TABLE films DROP CONSTRAINT films_pkey;
