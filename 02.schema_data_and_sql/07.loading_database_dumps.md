### 1. Load the file into your database

- What does the file do?

  - The file contains SQL statements, when imported the statements are executed.

- The command makes a new table.

  - DROP TABLE (if the table already exists, delete it)

    CREATE TABLE (create a new table)

    INSERT 0 1 (inserts data into the table three times)

    INSERT 0 1

    INSERT 0 1

- What does the first line do?

  - It checks to see if a table named films in the public database. If it does, it deletes it.

### 2. Write a SQL statement that returns all rows in the **films** table.

TABLE films;

SELECT * FROM films;
